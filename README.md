## Overview

This kata complements [Clean Code: Fundamentals, Ep. 3 - Functions](https://cleancoders.com/episode/clean-code-episode-3).

From Wikipedia:
> Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.
> Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible
> by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the
> word "buzz".

Write a program to print the first 100 FizzBuzz numbers, separated by newlines:
```
